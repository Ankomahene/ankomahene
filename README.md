I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in frontend development. Proficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Angular and Typescript. I am also a self-motivated person who is willing to go above and beyond on any project. I have worked in a startup environment and a large corporate team.
